    <center><i>"By law, with the use of poison, killing, torturing, castrating, destroying, in whole or in part, all elderly and all handicapped (Wzd), all criminals (Wfz) and all psychiatric patients (WvGGZ) here in the netherlands."</i></center>

In 2018 i informed the king of the netherlands that what he calls medicine in his care laws are not medicine but poison. 
This makes the care laws used in the netherlands not care laws but genocide laws.

The prosecutor decided to call it a "no basis to proceed", it requires a reconsider of the prosecutor to get the king in his cell and his genocide, thereby, stopped.
