    <i>"As article 6 but on other groups than defined"</i>
    <br><br>
    By law, with the use of poison, killing, torturing, castrating, destroying, in whole or in part, all elderly and all handicapped (Wzd), all criminals (Wfz) and all psychiatric patients (WvGGZ) here in the netherlands.
    <br><br>
    In 2018 i wrote the king of the netherlands that what he calls medicine in
    his laws are in fact not medicine but poison. Proof of being poison of these
    medicine were shown to the king, bringing him in the "knowing" was confirmed
    by the king saying "he has taken note of what i have written (zyprexa is poison)".
    <br><br>
    This makes that the care laws the king employs are not care laws but genocide
    laws with which the king is killing groups of the population by giving them
    poison instead of medicine in the "care" they are forced to undergo.
    <br><br>
    I wrote the prosecutor asking for an arrest of the king (make him stop).
    Prosecutor decided to call it a "no basis to proceed", it requires a
    reconsider of the prosecutor to get the king in his cell and his genocide, thereby, stopped.
