########

The prosecutor may, at any time, reconsider a decision whether to initiate an 
investigation or prosecution based on new facts or information AND  shall
not preclude the prosecutor from considering further information submitted
to him or her.

I read this as: "By adding Article 11 to the requirements, the prosecutor is actualy calling 
it a genocide and is missing the cooperation of the netherlands to arrest 
itâ€™s own king and thus stop the kings genocide."

So this case is not closable for any further reconsideration and the arrest
of the king, and thus the end of his genocide, is 1 decision away.
