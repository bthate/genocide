END OF GENOCIDE
###############

Arrest of the king is just 1 decision away, the "within the jurisdiction" decision.

Considering the jurisdiction over the genocide the king is doing is already
with the court, i think there is a different view on this matter between the
court that has that jurisidiction over genocide and the judgment of the
prosecutor.

The limit on the jurisdiction is the non cooperation of the netherlands to
stop the kings genocide. By the netherlands blocking the jurisdiction as part
of the kings genocide work, the court can excercise the jurisdicition to have
the arrest warrent to the king send immediately to europol to let the
collegues of the netherlands ensure the "cooperation" of the netherlands to
arrest the king and thus stop his genocide.

1 decision away. "within the jurisdiction"
