description
===========

 **GENOCIDE** is a python3 program that holds evidence that the king of the
 netherlands is doing a genocide, a written response where the king of
 the netherlands  confirmed taking note of “what i have written”, namely
 proof that medicine he uses in treatement laws like zyprexa, haldol,
 abilify and clozapine are poison. This means that the king of the
 netherlands is not using laws to provide care for the elderly,
 handicapped, psychiatric patients and criminals but is using the laws
 to administer poison. Poison that makes impotent, is both physical
 (contracted muscles) and mental (let people hallucinate) torture and
 kills members of the victim groups.

 
 **GENOCIDE** shows correspondence with the Internationnal Criminal Court
 about the genocide of the king of the netherlands (using the law to
 administer poison), including stats on suicide while the king of the
 netherland's genocide is still going on. Status is that there is not
 a basis to proceed, whether the king of the netherland's genocide
 doesn’t fit the description or the netherlands doesn’t want to
 cooperate with stopping the genocide the king of the netherlands is
 doing.

 | correspondence is under **EM_T04_OTP-CR-117_19** 
 | genocide start is set at **05-10-2018**
