"Under the Rome Stature, the Court may only exercise jurisdiction over
genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, as defined in the Rome Statute
(Articles 6 to 8), when commited on or after 1 July 2002 (Article 11). In
addition, the Court may only exercise jurisdiction over such crimes committed
on the territory of a State that has accepted the jurisdiction of the Court
or by a national of such State( Article 12) or where the Security Council
refers the situation to the Court (Atricle 13)."

| Since it's after 2002, the netherlands does the great member dance of
| cooperating done, and the "as defined in the Rome Statute" should be
| reason not to prosecute the king of the netherlands for his genocide.

| For the purpose of this Statute, "genocide" means any of the following acts
| committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical,
| racial or religious group, as such:

| * Killing members of the group;
| * Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
| * Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to
|   bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
| * Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
| * Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

This argument would lead to doing a genocide on a other group(s) then
mentioned, namely:

| *   verslaafden (addicts)
| *   bejaarden (elderly)
| *   ggz patienten (psychiatric patients)
| *   criminelen (criminials)
| *   gehandicapten (handicapped)
